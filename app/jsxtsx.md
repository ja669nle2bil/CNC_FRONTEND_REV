JSX and TSX both have their benefits and drawbacks. Here are some of the key differences between the two:

1. Type safety: TSX provides additional type safety, making it easier to write reliable and maintainable code. JSX does not provide type safety.

2. Learning curve: TSX requires knowledge of TypeScript, which can be a barrier to entry for some developers. JSX is easier to learn and use.

3. Development environment: TypeScript requires additional configuration and tooling in the development environment. JSX can be used with regular JavaScript tooling.

In general, TSX is a good choice for projects that require additional type safety and maintainability. JSX is a good choice for simpler projects or for developers who are not familiar with TypeScript.
